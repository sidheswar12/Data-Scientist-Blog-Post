## 1. Installation:

There is no dependent python libraries to run the code. Only Anaconda distribution of Python is necessary. Code should run without any issue using Python versions 3.x and above.
## 2. Project Motivation:

This is an Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player dataset.

It would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here as a football fan.

## Key interests would be:

    What is the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economicalï¼Ÿ
    How is nation team player in total market value distributed? 
    Which player skils set influence potential/wage? Can we predict player/player's potential based on his skills set?

## File Descriptions:

data.csv contains lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, Nationality, potential, wage, etc.

To showcsae all work related to above three questions, notebook has been created.
## Results:

The key findings of the code can be found at the post.
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements:

Credit must be given to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and also to kaggle/AirBnb for the data. Licensing for the data and other descriptive information can be found in the Kaggle link available https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
