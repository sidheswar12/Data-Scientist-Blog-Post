# Data-Scientist-Blog-Post

## Installation:

There is no dependent python libraries to run the code. Only Anaconda distribution of Python is necessary. Code should run without any issue using Python versions 3.x and above.
## Project Motivation:

This is an Udacity Nanodegree Data Scientist project. I chose FIFA 19 complete player data-set.

It would be quite interesting to apply data analysis skills here as a football fan.

## Key interests would be:

1. What is the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs. Which clubs are the most economicalï¼Ÿ
2. How is nation team player in total market value distributed? 
3. Which player skill set influence potential/wage? Can we predict player/player's potential based on his skill set?

## File Descriptions:

data.csv contains latest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes including age, Nationality, potential, wage, etc.

To showcsae all work related to above three questions, notebook has been created.
## Results:

The key findings of the code can be found at the post https://medium.com/@sidheswar.ghosh/how-player-performance-effect-with-money-df7d53d9d1b6?source=friends_link&sk=dd7ee83a11987857d170dd2f7724685b.
